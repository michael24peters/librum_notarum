## Detectors
#detector-physics
### Silicon Detection
**Silicon detectors** work by doping silicon strips into diodes, which are then arranged around the particle accelerator to produce a particle’s path. It has significantly higher resolution than MWPC. These detectors are also more radiation resistant than scintillating fiber detectors or MWPCs (but only due to the Lazarus effect[^1]).
		- **Scintillating fibers** are cheaper to make but provide lower resolution than silicon-based detectors. We thus use it for the more outer layers of the detector.
### Scintillation Detection
A typical **scintillation detector** consists of three main components:[^2]

1. **Scintillator material:** The core component of the detector, responsible for producing light or UV photons upon interaction with ionizing radiation. Scintillator materials can be classified into two main types: inorganic and organic. Inorganic scintillators are generally more efficient and have better energy resolution, but may be more expensive and less durable than organic scintillators, like plastic or liquid scintillators.
2. **Photodetector:** This component is responsible for converting the emitted light or UV photons from the scintillator into an electrical signal. The most commonly used photodetectors are photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). PMTs are known for their high sensitivity and low noise, while SiPMs offer compactness, lower voltage requirements, and insensitivity to magnetic fields.
3. **Signal processing and readout electronics:** The electrical signal generated by the photodetector is processed and analyzed by the readout electronics. This system may include amplifiers, filters, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and other components required for signal processing and data acquisition.

Scintillation detectors offer several advantages over other types of radiation detectors, such as gas-filled detectors and semiconductor detectors. Some of the main benefits include:

- High sensitivity and detection efficiency
- Fast response time, allowing for the detection of short-lived events or high counting rates
- Ability to measure a broad range of energies and types of ionizing radiation
- Good energy resolution, enabling the discrimination of different radiation energies or types

Despite their advantages, scintillation detectors also have some limitations:

- Scintillator materials can be sensitive to temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors, which may affect their performance and long-term stability
- Organic scintillators may degrade over time due to radiation damage or other factors, leading to reduced performance and the need for replacement
- The size and weight of certain scintillation detectors, particularly those using PMTs, can be a drawback for portable or space-constrained applications

### Multi-Wire Proportional Chamber Detection
A **multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC)** is like an RPC except that it uses a grid of wires with a high voltage instead of strip channels. The wires that get a pulse of current from the electron avalanche from ionized gas reveal the particle’s path.
