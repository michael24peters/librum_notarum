	- [ ] Find missing panels
- [ ] Module commissioning: 10/14
	- [ ] m2 top phi side dead
	- m1-9 good\*
	- [ ] m10, s30 needs repairs
	- m11 good
	- [ ] m12 untested
	- [ ] m13, all need repairs	
	- [ ] m14 untested (missing panels)
- [ ] Needing repairs: 4
	- [ ] (S4?) m2 top phi
	- [ ] S30 phi

    - [x] Procure connectors (still waiting on female db37s).
    - [ ] Make power supply -> panel cables
    - [ ] Make panel -> detector cables (need to finalize rack placement and LV distribution board)
- [ ] High voltage patch panel
    - [x] Procure aluminum
    - [x] Machine
    - [ ] High voltage filters (need to reapply heat shrinks)
    - [ ] Procure connectors (need to contact CPE Italia for a quote)
    - [ ] Make power supply -> panel cables (need to finalize HV power supply)
    - [ ] Make panel -> detector cables (need to finalize rack placement)

    - [x] Finalize stagger
    - [x] Procure skins and shims
    - [ ] Waiting for frames
- [x] Send shop drawings for service box
- [ ] Low voltage distribution board
    - [ ] Get design
    - [ ] Order
    - [ ] Determine mounting location on detector face (flexible)
