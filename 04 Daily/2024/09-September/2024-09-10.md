I think they knew a lot more than my talk assumed--a *lot* more. I adapted.

98.5% is suspect; the probability the gas doesn't ionize is 1.5%, so essentially we have a "perfect" detector; in some cases, *too* perfect (from Luca).

Reduce SF6 back to fractional for greenhouse gas reasons if we are able to (some dude)

Need efficiency scan error bars (some dude)

Figure out how to make an efficiency map (we should already have the data) (my idea, Luca independently suggested)

But I am only one person. I can't investigate our efficiency calculation, add new metrics, run commissioning test, repair singlets, and do service work (low voltage cables, patch panel, etc.). I cannot finish all that by December.

Two weeks for efficiency calculation investigation. Three weeks for new metrics. Three weeks for repairs and investigation. Two weeks for commissioning tests. Three more weeks to test repaired modules again.
