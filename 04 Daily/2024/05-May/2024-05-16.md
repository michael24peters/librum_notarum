## lxplus and CODEX ssh setup
The following works for MacOS

```
Host lxplus
	HostName lxplus.cern.ch
	User username <--- CERN login username
	PasswordAuthentication yes

Host codex
	HostName pccodex
	User codexb
	ProxyJump lxplus
	PasswordAuthentication yes
```

Then, to ssh into lxplus you simply type:

```
ssh lxplus
password-1
```

To login to codex you type:

```
ssh codex
password-1
password-2
```

Otherwise you must manually ssh

```
ssh username@lxplus.cern.ch
password-1
ssh codexb@pccodex
password-2
```

The passwords are:
- password-1: your lxplus password credentials
- password-2: rpc4fun
