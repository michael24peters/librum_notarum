## Process
- Muons → RPCs (resistive plate chambers) → FE (front-end) boards → trigger logic → TDCs (time to digital converters)
	- trigger logic + TDCs → computer (DAQ software)

1. Muons (or any charged particle) pass through the RPC, knocking electrons off the gas particles. High voltage (5.8kV) applies to the gas through plates to make it energetically favorable to flow towards plates through large electric field, i.e. high voltage keeps electrons from merging back into the atom. These knocked off e-’s create e- avalanche.
2. e- avalanche induces voltage/current in RPC strip (channel). RPCs are organized into layers of RPC triplets. The layers are named top, mid, and bot. Each singlet (layer) has 32 η channels and 64 φ channels.
3. FE board on each channel strip of RPC converts current into LVDS (low voltage differential signaling) signal. FE boards are provided a low voltage.
4. Signals are sent to the trigger logic, which picks out signal from noise. There is one trigger board per module (triplet) layer. Each module layer has a 32 channel ribbon cable input and output. There is also a coaxial signal output for the trigger. Once at the trigger board, the signal is inverted. Coincidence, i.e. AND, is then performed for every permutation of layer pairs. These coincidences are fed into a fan out, i.e. total OR, which feeds a single trigger signal time window to the TDC.
5. Signal and trigger are sent to the TDC. Since trigger had to be processed, it arrives later than the signal. To resolve this, we use a trigger offset. We use a function generator and oscilloscope to calibrate different shifts to align. The data is then stores as 32 bit words for each hit, with formatting following the TDC documentation. Figures of these 32 bit words with an example can be found in the [[#Event]] section below.
6. DAQ software then handles data acquisition and manipulation in four phases:
	1. **Acquisition** - TDC operation and raw data collected → .dat file output.
	2. **Conversion** - Raw data converted to global channel number and time measurement (currently 125 ns w/ manipulation to effectively create 1 ms time window).
	3. **Analysis** - Analyzes converted data for relevant variables for testing → .root file output.
	4. **Plotting** - Plots analyzed data → .png or .eps file output
