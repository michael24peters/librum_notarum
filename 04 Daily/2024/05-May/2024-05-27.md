## Phil meeting notes
- 2016 LHCb Run 2
- Which trigger (line)
- How to collect data
- How to get data to use
- What stripping line to use
- How to see signal eta → mu mu
- What background to expect
- Need MC data and decay files to exist
- What signal/background looks like, event selection (requirement on signal/background by pT, dimuon mass)
- Analysis strategy (measure w.r.t total eta cross section)
	- Measure eta some other way (eta → mu mu gamma) → mu mu mass, pT, p very different
- Characterize system uncertainties
- Natural width of eta is small enough to be unable to measure
- Branching fraction = eta → 2mu / eta → everything
	- Obviously we can’t get eta → everything, so instead we look at prpimary decay eta → gamma gamma, but this has a lot of decay. So instead we use eta → mu mu gamma since this is well-measured (Q^2)
- Primarily use DST or microDST
	- TEs (transient event storage) file with EventTree
- AllStreams (all stripping streams) (usually MC data, otherwise this would be way too much)
	- Open, look at some events, do something with it (mess around with eta → mu mu gamma)
- Gaudi framework ties LHCb framework together.
- Create DaVinci instance
- DSTs in ROOT format
- **appMgr loop through event** 
	- appMgr.evtsvc(): what does this mean/do?
		- configuring and loading file, connects to databases needed to understand file
		- event service, loop through events in file
- Use ssh -X (or -Y) lxplus

### ROOT launch

```
root
TBrowser t;
```

```
import ROOT
ROOT.TBrowser
```
 or
 ```
 t = ROOT.Tfile("xxxx.root")
 t.data
```
