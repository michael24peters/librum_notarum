- [x] #codex Fix two FEBs on phi panel (marked with "FEB problem" in tape)

## Codex meeting notes
- Developer access not good enough for commissioningTests repo. See below.
	- Just put the commissioningTests data into CERNBox
- EOS Storage Guide on Wiki complete
- High voltage box
	- Open up front or open up top
	- Possible epoxy shut, but then we can't access it again without breaking and replacing the box
