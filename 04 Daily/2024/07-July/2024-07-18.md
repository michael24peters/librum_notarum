## Meeting notes
- Developer access not good enough for commisioningTests repo. See Tasks.
- EOS Storage Guide on Wiki

### Gabi Presentation Notes
- I'm used to CNNs and FCNs, not so much GNNs. Is there back-propagation still happening? Where are these happening and the weights being stores? Is it accurate to say these "connections" don't necessarily hold physical meaning? From Michael Wilkinson's question, the impression I get is that this is the case. Slide 3-4 or 4-5
- AUC: area under curve; .5 is random guessing
	- Currently at .57
	- Mike thinks AUC sucks
- Efficiency vs false positive rate desired
- Can't use default FCN or CNN because input size (number of jets) changes. In other words, there is no regularly structured data.
