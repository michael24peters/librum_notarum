## Phil meeting notes
[[Phil meeting topics]]
Go into settings, change settings for pushing to master
OR make separate branch, push to it, then merge request
Future Circular Collider. Proposal to upgrade LHC. Three types:
1. Electron-electron. 400 GeV (LHCb parton center of mass energy is probably around 100 GeV, maybe less)
2. Hadron-hadron. 40-50 TeV. Like SSC (super synchrotron)
3. Electron-hadron

- eta -> mu mu may not entirely be out the day
	- Still do the angular analysis
	- Do original plan as starting step.
