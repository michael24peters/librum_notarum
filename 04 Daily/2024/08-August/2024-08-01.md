- 29mm total strip down to the insulator
- ~4mm strip to inner conductor
- [ ] #task/codex Heat shrink HV filters
- [x] #task/codex Get voltampermetric test data for m9 from Ellie

## m9
### Dead channels

- **S25**: none
- **S26**: phi 18
- **S27**: eta 8, 19; phi 13, 48

### Conversion

Top 8 eta
Top 19 eta

Top 79 phi1 (16 + 32 = 48)

Top 44 phi0 (13)
Mid 145 phi0 (18)

## Meeting notes
### Gabi's presentation
- Maybe more discussion in slide 7
- If there was a way to merge slides 8 and 9, it would make 8 make much more sense (to me, anyway)
- ~6 mins to Results
- Slide 12: Do you care more about FP or FN being lower?
- Slide 15: it would be nice if you had time to discuss this a bit more (if there's something interesting to take away from it)
- ~9 min presentation
- Conclusion says a lot of new things
