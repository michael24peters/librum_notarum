SHV connectors (the twisty ones) on HV power supply; same ones on power supply we use for testing. Industry standard. Look up YouTube video for how to crimp onto wire. "SHV connector crimping".

## Meeting notes

- [x] #task/codex Get a count of many singlets we'll have and what spares we'll have, if any.
	
- **My end:**
	- Jake is gone
	- [[Schedule]]
	- Low voltage patch panel connectors procured. I should now be able to create the cables from power supply to patch panel, but I'll need to experiment with them first.
