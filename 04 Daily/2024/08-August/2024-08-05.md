## Meeting notes
- Email Titus and Phil all this info; also put it on the wiki
- Register for RPC event
- [RPC week](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1354736/). Register for this, book hotels, book flights
	- Put together presentation, give practice talk at next UC group meeting (15 August), then give Codex-b practice talk
	- 15+5 minutes, 15-20 slides. Introduction to what Codex-b is (brief) (this is why we want to build b, this is why we're building beta, here are the details, show the tests in digestible form, gas mixture, construction techniques, about 1/2-2/3 on RPCs; 1/4 intro, 1/4 tech behind it and where its going, 1/2 on results)
- Box info: have them email Phil about it
- Elenid and Mike January visit from Ellie and Saul
- Mike Wilkinson on assembly time for frame and structure and superstructure
- Weird one not usable because it's not flat. Going to have to do some surgery to make it flat. Box cutter whatever half is sticking up, cut along edge until it falls into place. Alternate: file the edge (better).
