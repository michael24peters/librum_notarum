## Getting MC data

- Bookkeeping path through DIRAC (real data): LHCb/Collision16/Beam6500GeV-VeloClosed-<\P>/Real Data/Turbo03/94000000/LEPTONS.MDST
- Bookkeeping path through DIRAC (simulated data, eta -> mu mu gamma): [[2024-05-20#Phil meeting notes]]. See [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-datapkg/Gen/DecFiles/-/blob/v30r106/dkfiles/eta_mumugamma=TightCut.dec) for direct dec file.

- Oral Exam
	- March 2025 exam date, presentation, written report, questions
	- presentation, written report -> done work, plan for future
	- Write report month in advance
	- Present to LHCb group beforehand
	- Studying: roughly equivalent to Alan Schwartz exam studying
	- Month to prepare for everything

## Phil meeting notes
- Account Management (CERN) -> Services -> EOS/CERNBox
- `cd /eos/user/p/petersm` <- big files go here
- `cd  /afs/cern.ch/work/p/petersm` <- AFS workspace (lxplus directory)
- ln -s
- Look up CERNBox, read MacOS, fileexplorer
- rapidity
	- flux roughly constant per unit rapidity
	- rapidity lorentz invariant
	- rapidity depends on mass
		- but mass not usually known
		- so we use pseudorapidity
	- two are same for massless particles
		- lighter particles: roughly the same
	- [x] #task/analysis plot of pseudorapidity for all final state particles produced in an lhcb collision
		- not all flat, some structure, between certain ranges somewhat flat
		- b-production usually forward or backward direction
			- pp -> b, look at distributions using pythia
		- [x] Generate hadron collision
		- [x] Cut between eta 2 and 5
		- [x] Take output particles and plot them
	- eta -> mu mu gamma
