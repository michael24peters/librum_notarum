![[CODEX-beta_preparation.pdf]]

- Gas system
	- standard mix: 30% CO2, 64% R134a, 5% isobutane, 1% SF6
		- 1 bottle per year for each gas; ~5,500 CHF per year
	- Installation anticipated to be complete by end of August (gas)
- Power supply
	- 16 channel, 9kV, CAEN, complicated connectors
- YETS: year-end technical stop
- Replicate test system with one singlet underground in September
- Start DAQ work in August
	- Someone will need to physically build the system
	- Firmware guy lined up; remotely working

- faraday cage testing?
- CMS mixture w/out CO2; 1% efficiency drop expected with CO2
- Lay RPCs flat on ground, setting support blocks on wood
- 1 day to construct module, 4 days to test
	- [x] 1 wk/module, 9 modules to go; 9 weeks + 1 flex weeks →
