# 2024-06-25 

- [ ] #task/codex **S6 RPC is bad.** Either the electronics need to be replaced or a whole new phi board needs to be used.

## Phil meeting notes
- [RPC week](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1354736/). Can give talk, up to me whether I'm interested or not
- Pseudorapidity plot not exactly even (drops by factor of 2), but it's much more flat than the theta plot, which lets us roughly approximate the pseudorapidity plot as flat. If you plot from -10 to 10, you can see a clear peak.
- Angular distributions of eta -> mu+mu- and eta_prime -> mu+mu-
