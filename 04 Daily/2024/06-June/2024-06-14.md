## CODEX-b wrap-up notes
- [Blois](http://blois.in2p3.fr/2024/index.html), October 20-25, 2024
- [Constitution](https://www.overleaf.com/project/656b2a6321389d7314be820c), Tuesdays 16h (CERN time)
- Transverse detector: pull together behind a single project within 6 months
	- ANUBIS getting ATLAS backing and proving they are a zero background detector puts them in front, complete failure otherwise
	- MATHUSLA and CODEX-b convergence
	- Need to be able to independently confirm SHiP results
- [x] What is FCC
	- If European strategy is full steam ahead with FCC then we're all done (Vava's words)
- Cost of civil engineering is the big hurdle and deciding factor
- Lack institutes with quality engineerings and technical personnel
- Physics discussion in mid-July

## Technical Timeline
- Finish RPC construction and testing: August ‘24
- Move first triplet underground: August ‘24
	- If prototype cart is tested and arrives in time
- Gas installation finish: likely September ‘24
- Install detector: October ’24 MD and TS (17-23)
	- Will need several hands, confirm the date later
- Test RPC’s and gas mixture underground with B904 setup during September - December ‘24
- Full installation and LHCb integration: YETS (Dec ‘24 - March ‘25)
- Will need piquet-shifters (in 1-week intervals), check your availabilities in ‘25!!
