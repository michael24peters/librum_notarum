## Hit and trigger flow

- RPCs are like monkeys are just send hits out to TDC
- TDC digitizes this info to trigger board
- For each raw hit, coincidence is done, then sent back to TDC as trigger signal
- Header and EOB related to trigger signal, raw data related to raw hits

Page 10 of the TDC documentation contains useful example for how TDC works. See [[2024-05-03#Event|here]].
