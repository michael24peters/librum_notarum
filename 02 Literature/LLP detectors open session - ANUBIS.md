# LLP detectors open session - ANUBIS

- collect data separately, then combine with information from ATLAS, which has some challenges with LHC clock synchronization
	- luckily, CODEX-b does not plan to do this and will be using LHCb DAQ
- 90% uptime during 2024 LHC runs -> 1 TB data collected, 10^9 events
