## Lecture 1

- Generate hard collision we are interested in, since most collisions are uninteresting. Then work outwards.
- Purpose of MC is to compute integrals
- We can improve converge by a factor of 10 by using knowledge of function to not uniformly distribute points, but instead generate more points where function is largest. See slide 12.

## Difficulties
- Don't understand event generators (slide 23)
- Central limit theorem (in context of MC integrals)
- Slide 26-27 totally lost

## Lecture 2


## Lecture 3

- Arrived on slide 17
- **Takeaway:** Need to improve my theoretical knowledge in order to understand how we can create models, estimates, and simulations for them.
- [ ] #question/mcnet Slide 19. String model of mesons: so the energy eventually transfers to a sort of “tension” in the string. It was emphasized that this is not like a spring, but rather like a yo-yo…so the quark-antiquark experience no force of attraction until the string is taut in this model? Or just a constant force? Either way, that makes no sense, though I suppose it’s just a model
