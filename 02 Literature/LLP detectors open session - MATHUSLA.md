- Civil engineering seems to be a very large barrier to entry for a research project whose costs seem very common to underestimate
- Detector technology
	- Tracking layers plastic scintillator bars, wavelength shifting fibers then focus to silicon photomultipliers
	- Wavelength shifting fibers: 1.5mm diameter, optical fiber with core doped with fluor(s) to get same light wavelength
	- Need sub-ns timing resolution
		- .54ns resolution from cosmic muon coincidences
	- SiPMs measure light output: signal proportional to number of incident photons; can be temperature dependent; also dark noise at high temperatures
	- Layer of long bars (each tracking layer 16 bar assemblies) make up main component of tracking detector
	- MATHUSLA-10 pre-proposal around 2.5 million CAD, non-including personnel
