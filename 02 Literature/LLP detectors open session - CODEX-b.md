# LLP detectors open session - CODEX-b

- European strategy report next Spring; need to pull together for one transverse LLP detector ahead of this
- Need to make space in server room for both servers and CODEX
	- Might need to stick servers in between RPC layers? This would certainly lead to an efficiency drop, but we don't yet know by how much
