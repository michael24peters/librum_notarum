[Relativistic Breit-Wigner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Breit%E2%80%93Wigner_distribution) assumes constant width, which we don't have, so we need more complicated form (Eq. 4). Eq. 2 close to standard rel. breit-wigner. Phase space integration of decay (Eq. 3). F_eta(M^2): how dimuom resonance (how much it couples to rho, among other things). Low masses this term is effectively 1. Eta mass (.6 GeV) width is narrow. Close to mass it becomes slightly more important.

VMD: Let's say you have off-shell photon produced (like here). When you have this, it will mix with QCD meson resonances with same quantum numbers as photon (it is vector state), e.g. rho, omega, phi mesons. If you look at production, VMD says it will go through nearest resonance (which is rho, the nearest broad resonance). Photon will quantum mechanically mix with nearest resonance.

NA60 very forward experiment. Fixed target (indium) hit with proton beam. Rapidity: difference in rapidity value. large difference in what they can cover (target) and what happens (central).

- [ ] #task/analysis **Exercise**: have proton with energy 400 GeV, indium ion at rest, you produce something. Pseudorapidity range in lab frame is 2.8-4.0 (page 3). Figure out pseudorapidity range in center of mass frame of proton-indium system. Then compare it to range for center of mass production. That will answer this question.

See sect. 2. 
- 9 sub-targets (among them indium) of different thicknesses. 
- Luminosity is what is relevant to them. For beam dump (fixed target) relevant number is protons on target.
- Detector has vertexing system, muon spectrometer system, hadron absorber in between, and magnet (for momentum measurement).

See ssect. 2.2.
- Found one track, trace back to previous track and vertexing system, then get a track out of it. Muon track minus track in vertexing system, divided by uncertainty, some sum in there, that gives us chi squared.
- Take muon track, figure out vertex track, match them up, must be within this requirement. Want to make sure it's one object, refit track using all points together.

An example configuration at LHCb. Line made for muon, one made for vertex system, partial diff eq for stepping forward and back, match two curves together.

Signal to background ratio: track in muon system and vertex system, if you match them up, it passed through hadron system as well, tells you it must be minimal ionizing particle. Expect pion would be absorbed in material *or* something would be produced and seen in muon system but not vertexing system.

Mass resolution: more points gives more constraints to line. Magnet system definitely not in muon system.
1. Something before, something after magnet
2. Pain to do track pattern recognition. Have to match hits to line, much harder if they curve.

They're looking for higher-momentum stuff, so...Hadron material should be before or near start of magnetic field (they may not have) because low-momentum stuff will get swept out (noise), leaving only higher momentum stuff (signal).

Our (LHCb) momentum resolution is something like 0.5%. Mass of eta is 600 MeV, so our mass resolution is something like 3 MeV compared to their 30-35 MeV/c2.
