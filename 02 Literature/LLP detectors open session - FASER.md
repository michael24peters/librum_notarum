# LLP detectors open session - FASER

- Search for new, light, LLPs, and study neutrions
- ~500m from ATLAS collision point
- FASER was able to cannibalize components from other detectors
- Very simple design
- FASTER structure:
	- EM calorimeter
	- scintillator system
	- scintillator veto system
	- interface tracker
	- three permanent dipole magnets
- ~1,000 muons/second going through FASER
- Idea for dark photon search is that it decays in first decay volume, passing through first tracker unnoticed, two particles (e pair) deposits a lot of energy in calorimeter
- Veto inefficiency is something like 10^-20, which is basically nothing
- Axiom-like particle (ALP) search, looking for one that couples to SU(2)\_L gauge bosons
	- Produced in b- or s- hadron decay; decays to two photons
	- No incoming particles, lots of energy in calorimeter
	- Unlike dark photon, ALP could decay anywhere in detector volume
	- Neutrino background
- For understanding analysis: background is characterized, simulation estimation done, cut made (see slide 15).
- Helped by Physics Beyond Colliders
- $300-400k to do the civil engineering for the tunnel renovation, paid for by CERN (see slide 29)
