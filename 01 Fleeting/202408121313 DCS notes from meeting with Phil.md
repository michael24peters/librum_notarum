# 202408121313 DCS notes from meeting with Phil

 *First monitor just in pit; monitor external would be nice; control from CAEN all we care about*. Clara is the expert from LHCb. Initial monitoring in pit by October (when first triplet goes in) is the goal but not required. Needs to be running by January.
