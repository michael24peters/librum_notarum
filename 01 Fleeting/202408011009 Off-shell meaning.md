# 202408011009 Off-shell meaning

 What does “on-shell” mean? 
 
 Answer: *More formally known as "off the mass shell". Configurations of a physical system that do not satisfy classical equations of motion*. This still does not make total sense to me, especially when the claim is made that virtual particles in QFT are off-shell.
