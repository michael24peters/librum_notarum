## Status

- m1-9 good\*
- m2 top phi side dead
- m10 not good
- m11 good
- m12 untested
- m13 phi not good
- m14 incomplete (missing panels)

# m10

Comprised of s30 (top)(problem), s29 (mid), s28 (bot)

## Normal Results

Normal electronic noise:

![[good-e-noise.png]]

Normal high voltage noise:

![[good-hv.png]]

## Operation test

Bad operation test. The first channel should be 64; returns to "normal" at channel 70:

![[bad-oper-test-1-m10.png]]

Bad operation test a couple days later. Now it looks even worse. The number of hits is dramatically higher than normal:

## High voltage scan

1000V:

![[hv-1000-m10.png]]

2000V:

3000V:

![[hv-3000-m10.png]]

4000V:

![[hv-4000-m10.png]]

## Chamber noise

Originally this looked fine, if perhaps a bit low. But when you turn the trigger on this vanishes (see above):

![[bad-chamber-noise-1-m10.png]]

Same issue with chamber noise later on (post RPC week):

## Fake muon

Bad fake muon test, just to demonstrate the problem continuing under different circumstances:

**Conclusion**: Not sure why the FEBs have a higher current passing through them, but it seems to be consistent across top and mid (and mid is fine).

### Oscilloscope

When plugged into TDCs, visually I'm seeing a signal. **Conclusion:** we are receiving a steady stream of hits. (We already knew this.)

The following tests were then taken at working point, as well. I plugged the oscilloscope into the 

This is a good signal. Mid, phi1, FEB 1 (all pins same):

![[IMG_1574.jpeg]]

This is a bad signal. Top, phi1, FEB 1, first pin (1-6 same):

![[IMG_1582.jpeg]]

This is a good signal. Top, phi1, FEB 1, last pin (7-8 same):

![[IMG_1581.jpeg]]

This is a good signal. Bot, phi1, FEB 1 (all pins same):

![[IMG_1587.jpeg]]

This is a good signal. Top, phi1, FEB 4, pin 1 (all same):

![[IMG_1589.jpeg]]

**Conclusion:** The signals are consistent with the plots generated. Something is wrong with the signal coming in.

### Attempted solution

I tried re-soldering the connections from panel to FEB 1 for pins 1-2, but it made no difference. I also checked the resistance across the first two FEB resistors (i.e. resistor-ground), and the results are consistently 9.3 ohms (we expect ~10 ohms). Since this is a little off, I checked mid and bot resistance and got the same thing.

**Conclusion:** The connection is fine.

### Final thoughts

It seems there is something wrong with the internals on this front-end board, but it's not clear to me what that is. Moreover, there are other 

# m13

### eta

Here are the results from an operation test on the eta side:

![[m13_eta_operationTest.png]]

I haven't yet tried to resolder any connections, nor have I measured the low voltage values. These issues may or may not be related to m10.

## Efficiency scan

**Note: ignore the eta results.**

The efficiency is clearly lacking in phi top:

![[eff-m13.png]]

### phi1, top, 5800V

All layers should look the same, but they clearly do not, which is causing the efficiency issues:

![[phi1-top-m13.png]]

### phi0, top, 5800V

Different issue, but this time the first FEB of bot seems to be the main issue. Still, the top layer is performing noticeably worse:

![[phi0-top-m13.png]]

### phi1, mid, 5800V

But if we look at a mid efficiency scan with all layers at working point (5800V), everything looks fine:
