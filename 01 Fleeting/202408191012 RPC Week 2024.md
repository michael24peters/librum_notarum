- 3m concrete shield wall
- Goals
	- Validate background estimates
	- Establish proof of principle with RPC design
	- Integrate with LHCb software trigger
- Intended to collect data in 2025

## Data Flow

- Cosmic muons spark a current in the gas gap. 
- Current in strip panels converted to LVDS signal by front end electronics. 
- Signals sent through trigger logic to produce a signal only for valid hits. 
- Hits and trigger sent to time-to-digital converter (TDC). 
- The TDC interfaced with a computer for further data analysis.

## RPC design

- Based on BIS78 RPC design from ATLAS[^3]
- Two coordinates from two orthogonal strip panels
- Modular - singlet-triplet
- Gas: 94.7% R-134a (1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane), 5% isobutane, and 0.3% SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride)

## Front End Boards

- Front end electronics boards: 8 channels of preamplifier + 2 full-custom ASIC discriminators with 4 channels each and Low-Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) transmitters integrated directly inside the board.
	- Minimize gas gap for best time resolution

| ![[Front end board.png]]                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Front end electronics design. Amplify the signal from the gas gap, output hits as a falling-edge LVDS pulse. |

| ![[Discriminator concept.png]]                                                                                                                                    |

## Trigger Logic

- One trigger board per triplet layer (top, mid, bot).
- Discriminator inverts the signal from trigger boards.
- Coincidence unit for each permutation of layer pairs.
- FI/FO collects the coincidences and outputs a single trigger signal.
- Trigger signal is then sent to the TDC, which is combined with hit data from FEBs.

## DAQ

- DAQ software then handles data acquisition and manipulation in four phases:
	1. **Acquisition** - TDC operation and raw data collected → .dat file output.
	2. **Conversion** - Raw data converted to global channel number and time measurement (currently 125 ns w/ manipulation to effectively create 1 ms time window).
	3. **Analysis** - Analyzes converted data for relevant variables for testing → .root file output.
	4. **Plotting** - Plots analyzed data → .png or .eps file output

## Commissioning Tests

1. Gas gap: leak tests
2. High voltage: distribution and voltamperometric curve
3. Low voltage: distribution
4. Cosmic-ray test: singlet performance and behavior

## Testing

- Cosmic muons used to cause electron avalanche, which means out plot positions between two singlets’ phi-eta coordinate should line up, i.e. should look like the following:

![[operationTest_trigOn_5800V_60s_FiredChannelsCorr_FINE.png]]

- **Event:** time window in which the TDC accepts hits, generated by the hardware trigger.
- **ALL:** minimum bias hit acceptance; no software trigger, i.e. anything detected.
- **FINE:** additional software trigger, requiring that hits in multiple layers within an event occur in the same channel, e.g. hit in top phi channel 10 and mid phi channel 10 is a double FINE hit.
