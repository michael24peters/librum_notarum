# 202406121154 What I need to learn for the oral exam

- **Commonly used detector technologies**
- **Silicon doping**
- **Factorization theorem**
- Understand QED + analysis process in and out; propagators, perturbative calculations, etc.
- **PDFs**
- Higgs mechanism.
- Why does symmetry breaking tell us anything? 
	- **Answer:** symmetry comes from conservation. If we observe symmetry breaking then we know there is some violation occurring or approximation in our models. If we confine things to conserve energy, we expect some symmetry from input to output. This is what allows us to find errors in our model.
- Schwartz is going to ask me about **PMTs** and the difference between all the other components. Coupled to this, he will ask **why we use different detectors and detection methods in a detector**? Why not just have layers of the same thing? See [[Detectors#Detectors|Detectors]].
	- **Answer:** balance of cost, resolution, and radiation resistance. 
		- **Silicon detectors** are very expensive but provide high resolution. We thus use it for the closest detection layer, such as the VELO at LHCb. 
		- **Scintillating detectors** and **multi-wire proportional chambers** are cheaper but have lower resolution and cannot withstand as much radiation. Some scintillating detectors can be more performant but are much more sensitive to the environment.
- **Read** the book Schwartz emailed you to read. It talks about the foundations of detectors and the why of everything that every paper is built upon.
